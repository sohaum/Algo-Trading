# Euclidean Distance Analysis

## Overview
This notebook explores the calculation of Euclidean distances between high-dimensional vectors, employing both loop-based and vectorized methods. The goal is to analyze computational efficiency and statistical properties, such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.

## Key Sections

1. **Data Generation**  
   - Generates sample points in n-dimensional space using a uniform distribution.
   
2. **Distance Calculation**  
   - Implements two methods for calculating distances: a loop-based approach and a vectorized approach.

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Calculates and interprets statistical measures of Euclidean distances: mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Plots histograms comparing observed data against theoretical distributions for varying dimensions and sample sizes.
   
5. **Performance Evaluation**  
   - Compares performance between the loop-based and vectorized implementations.

## Dependencies
- Python libraries: `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Matplotlib`
  
## Usage
To use or modify this notebook, ensure all dependencies are installed and run each section sequentially.
